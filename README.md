Here is where I make my mistakes..
Currently the filter files are semi-strict filters for POE2 from neversink with some random meme soundbytes. at this point I need something truly beautful to signal the drop of a divine. This filter achieves that and changes the base drop noises to slightly more annoying and definitely funnier sounds.
